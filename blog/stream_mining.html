	    				<p>Data Stream Mining is the process of extracting knowledge structures from continuous, rapid data records.
<br>
In many data stream mining applications, the goal is to predict the class or value of new instances in the data stream given some knowledge about the class membership or values of previous instances in the data stream.In many applications, especially operating within non-stationary environments, the distribution underlying the instances or the rules underlying their labeling may change over time, i.e. the goal of the prediction, the class to be predicted or the target value to be predicted, may change over time. This problem is referred to as concept drift.
<br>
In predictive analytics and machine learning, the <b>concept drift</b> means that the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model is trying to predict, change over time in unforeseen ways. This causes problems because the predictions become less accurate as time passes.
<br>
To prevent deterioration in prediction accuracy because of concept drift, both active and passive solutions can be adopted. Active solutions rely on triggering mechanisms, e.g.,<b> change-detection tests </b>  to explicitly detect concept drift as a change in the statistics of the data-generating process.

In conclusion , Concept drift cannot be avoided for complex phenomenon that are not governed by fixed laws of nature. All processes that arise from human activity, such as socioeconomic processes, and biological processes are likely to experience concept drift. Therefore periodic retraining, also known as refreshing, of any model is necessary.
